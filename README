This Python script reads a trajectory in GROMACS' XTC format plus a
compatible PDB file describing the molecular system. It writes the
system and trajectory data to a netCDF file using MMTK conventions.

Usage: xtc2nc [options] pdb_file xtc_file nc_file

pdb_file and xtc_file must describe the same system. nc_file is the
name of the netCDF trajectory that is created.

Options:

  --cell-shape
     one of 'infinite', 'orthorhombic', or 'parallelepipedic'.
     The default is 'parallelepipedic'. Note that the cell shape
     information cannot be obtained from xtc_file nor from pdb_file.
     It is, however, required for a correct interpretation of the
     data. A wrong cell-shape leads to erroneous data in the
     converted trajectory.

  --block-size=number
     specifies the block structure of the netCDF trajectory. The
     default value of 1 optimizes the trajectory for step-by-step access
     to conformations. Larger values favour atom-by-atom access to
     one-particle trajectories for all times, which is required for the
     calculation of dynamic quantities. The highest sensible value is
     the number of steps in the trajectory.
